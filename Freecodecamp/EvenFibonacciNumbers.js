//Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence. 
//0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 ...
//where any number in sequence is given by: 
// FiboNum = sum of the first and second fibonacci numbers 
// and
// the first number is sequence is 0 
// the second number in the sequence  is 1.

// The even number Fibonacci sequence is:
// 0, 2, 8, 34, 144, 610, 2584â€¦. 

// In the logic, given a number, we find the sum of all even fibonacci numbers
// only the next EVEN fibonacci number is added to the SUM
// Keep looping for given number until reaching the end of the given number
// then return the SUM
